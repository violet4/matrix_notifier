# Matrix Notifier

Matrix Notifier presents a simple python program that opens a long-lived connection to a Matrix server instance and listens for HTTP requests on localhost to send messages on your behalf.

This makes it easy to enable any program that is capable of sending a localhost HTTP request to send messages within Matrix.

Uses Python, python-nio, and flask.
